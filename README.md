# 🧬✨ Sequence Tools

Welcome to **Sequence Tools** – a repository of tools for wrangling sequence data in Python:

## 🚀 Tools & Descriptions

### 🏷️ Header Management
- **🔄 `replace_heads.py`** – Swap out old headers in an MF file with new ones from a text file.
- **📝 `heditor.py`** – Cleans up GenBank headers, leaving only the species name and accession number.
- **🎭 `unique_headers.py`** – Strips special characters from headers, truncates after the first space, and adds a unique ID.
- **🆔 `unique_ids.py`** – Replaces existing headers in a FASTA file with unique numeric IDs (`>1`, `>2`, etc.).

### 🔍 Sequence Search & Extraction
- **🧩 `find_seq_overlap.py`** – Identifies overlapping sequences in a target sequence.
- **🔎 `get_seq_go.py`** – Fetches sequences from a multi-FASTA file based on IDs.
- **📜 `splice.py`** – Extracts sequence regions based on position input.
- **🛠️ `gbk_to_proteome.py`** – Extracts all protein sequences from a GenBank file.
- **🔬 `phd_to_fasta.py`** – Converts PHD files to FASTA format.
- **⚡ `nhmmer_or_hmmsearch_to_fasta.py`** – Extracts FASTA sequences from HMMER search results.

### 🔢 ORF & Codon Analysis
- **🧬 `longest_orf.py`** – Finds the longest ORF in all frames and detects in-frame stop codons.
- **🔄 `reverse_complement.py`** – Generates the reverse complement of a sequence.

### 📊 File Splitting & Filtering
- **📂 `mulif_to_singlef.py`** – Converts a multi-FASTA file into individual FASTA files.
- **📏 `get_by_size.py`** – Extracts sequences from an MF file that meet a length threshold.
- **✂️ `split_fasta_ntimes.py`** – Splits a multi-FASTA file into smaller multi-FASTA chunks of N sequences.
- **🚮 `remove_duplicate_fasta.py`** – Removes duplicate sequences (including headers).

### 🤖 Exonerate Analysis
- **📑 `extract_exonerate_output.py`** – Extracts GFF, ORF, and CDS from Exonerate output.
- **🏆 `exonerate_highest_score.py`** – Retrieves the highest-scoring alignment from Exonerate output (when you don't want to use `bestn`).

### 📜 Text & ID Comparisons
- **📄 `compare_txt.py`** – Compares two text files (e.g., accession IDs) and reports differences.
