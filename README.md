Some useful sequence tools written in python 2.7


	splice.py
- To get any sequence based on positions


	longest_orf.py
- To find the longest orf from a set of frames and identify presence of in frame stop codons


	get_seq_go.py
- Get sequence from a multifasta file based on id


	reverse_complement.py
- reverse complements a sequence


	phd_to_fasta.py
- Gets fasta sequence from phd file


	mulif_to_singlef.py
- Separates multi fasta file to single fasta files


	remove_duplicate_fasta.py
- removes identical sequences (with identical headers)


	extract_exonerate_output.py
- separates exonerate output into gff, orf and cds


	highest_score_exonerate.py
- gets highest scoring sequence alignment from exonerate output (when you don't want to use bestn)
